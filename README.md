# Bacteria-Lot-Identification-Matrix-Program

Identify bacteria using this simple friendly user interface!

This Python 3.6.9 script with 2,687 lines of code identifies bacteria using a matrix of phenotypic traits analyzed using the Bayes Theorem, Geometric Means, or the Phi Coefficient. 

First, either hit the "Submit" button after selecting the group of the bacteria isolate that you are attempting to identify (ie, Gram Negative Facultative Anaerobe Bacullis, etc) or fill in the search bar to "Search" for traits of a known bacteria. You may use slider bars to skew for favorable agar growth factors and/or the environmental location of your sample. A new window will appear showing a window to either input or display trait test results. If you are entering traits, hit "Identify" to show your three highest bacteria identification likelihood scores or "Reset" to clear your test results.

 This program was created using Python 2.7 in 2012 at Baylor University to analyze freshwater samples for the Hartman Lab and is copyrighted under a GNU license. It was then rewritten using Python 3.6 in 2020. Use any part of this program you wish with my blessing, just credit the author.
