# Bacteria-Lot-Identification-Matrix-Program

Identify bacteria using a simple friendly user interface!

This Python 3.6.9 script with 2,687 lines of code identifies bacteria using a matrix of phenotypic traits analyzed using the Bayes Theorem, Geometric Means, or the Phi Coefficient. It also allows for you to look up traits of known bacteria samples and skew for the environmental location of your sample. This program was created using Python 2.7 in 2012 at Baylor University to analyze freshwater samples for the Hartman Lab and is copyrighted under a GNU license. It was then rewritten using Python 3.6 in 2020. Use any part of this program you wish with my blessing, just credit the author.
